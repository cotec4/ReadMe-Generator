# ReadMe-Generator

This was a very tricky assignment that took a lot of patience and hard work. The goal was to use a javascript file with command-line functionality to create a ReadMe Generator. I struggled initially with the links in the generated ReadMe but also then struggled to use template literals effectively throughout the assignment.

The command-line (inquirer / prompt) was the easier part of the assignment honestly.
